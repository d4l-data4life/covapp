    "data_privacy_content_bmg": "<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>\n(Status: 1 May 2020)\n\n<strong>1. Controller</strong>\n\nThe provider of the Website and controller of the processing of your personal data relevant to the use of the CovApp is \n\nBundesministerium für Gesundheit (Federal Ministry for Health) \n53123 Bonn\n Germany\n\nTel.: <a href=\"tel:+49228994410 \">+49 (0) 228-99441-0 </a>\nE-Mail: <a href=\"mailto:poststelle@bmg.bund.de\">poststelle@bmg.bund(dot)de</a>\n\nAs long as the data is processed exclusively on the user's device with the help of the installed software, the users themselves are controller.\n\n<strong>2. Data protection officer</strong>\n\nYou can contact our Data Protection Officer via email <a href=\"mailto:DSB@bmg.bund.de\">DSB@bmg.bund(dot)de</a> or our postal address (see 1) with the addition “Die Datenschutzbeauftragt” (German for “Data Protection Officer”).\n\n<strong>3. Which data is processed for which purposes and on which legal basis?</strong>\n\n<strong> a) Visiting the website</strong>\n\nThe CovApp is a web application. When the Web page is called, the following data is automatically transferred to the Web server of the Bundesministerium für Gesundheit:\n\n- IP address of the device used for the retrieval\n- Web address (URL) of the page from which the file was requested (referrer)\n- Date and time of the request\n- Amount of data transmitted\n- Description of the type of web browser used.\n\nThe processing of this browser data, which does not show a clear name of the user, but which nevertheless contains a (pseudonymised) personal reference via the IP address, is technically necessary and is carried out in our legitimate interest in showing you our website and in ensuring the stability and security of the website. The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. e GDPR and sec. 3 BDSG. The above-mentioned data will not be stored for a longer period of time after use of the app.\n\n<strong> b) Filling out the questionnaire and creating a QR code</strong>\n\nThe CovApp should help you to assess whether there is a need for further clarification regarding a Covid-19 infection. This offer does not replace medical advice or treatment. No directly personalised application or registration necessary to use CovApp. \n\nThe CovApp contains questions about current symptoms, your recent trips and possible interactions. The answers you give to the questions and the automatically displayed recommendations for action depending on your answers are processed exclusively locally on the device you use (smartphone, tablet or PC); at this stage no data is transmitted to the server. Your answers to the questionnaire are stored local and protected on your device only.\n\nIt is possible to summarize the answers and further information you have provided in a QR code after the questionnaire has been completed. This is also done purely locally and without data exchange with the Bundesministerium für Gesunheit. At a later point in time, for example while seeing a physician,it is possible for you to show the QR code stored locally on your device and to transmit the information contained therein. This makes it easier to collect the necessary medical data and noticeably relieves the medical care. \n\nThe legal basis for the disclosure of your health-related data in these cases is Art. 9 para. 2 lit. i GDPR in conjunction with § 22 para. 1 No. c BDSG or, in the case of your expressed consent - which can be revoked at any time - Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR. \n\nYou can delete the data stored by CovApp on your terminal device at any time by clicking \"Delete answers\" at the end of the questionnaire. \n\n<strong> c) Possible analysis of user behavior and error analysis</strong>\n\nYou can voluntarily agree to the analysis of your user behaviour and the error analysis serving to improve the offer. For this purpose, a cookie banner appears at the beginning of the visit to the website, which asks for your voluntary consent (linked to your IP address). Sensitive answers to the questions are not recorded for the analysis. The analysis is focused on the evaluation of user data for scientific purposes and to improve the CovApp, i.e. how often the possibility of creating and using the QR Code is used. Your data will be anonymised before use. The legal basis for this is your voluntary and informed consent under Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR to the collection and anonymisation of your personal data for use in the relevant analysis. You can revoke your consent at any time with effect for the future. The legality of the processing of your data until revocation remains unaffected. Your consent includes the following:\n\naa) Analysis of user data for scientific purposes and to optimize the application\n\nThe anonymised data obtained from the analysis of your use of the CovApp helps the Bundesministerium für Gesundheit to identify “hot spots” by evaluating time periods, risk factors and whereabouts, among other things. By determining at which point the answering of the questions is frequently interrupted, we can optimize the questionnaire.\n \nThis analysis allows valuable conclusions to be drawn for pandemic control. It is not possible for us to draw any conclusions about your person on the basis of the data collected for usage analysis.\n\nThe analysis is carried out with the help of \"Matomo\", a free web analysis software that does not transfer any data to third parties. The following data is collected by Matomo and processed anonymously for the usage analysis: \n\n- IP address\n- Date and time of the request\n- Title of the URLs viewed, URLs of the web pages viewed, URLs of previous web pages (only within the app) \n- Screen resolution, time in your own time zone, time to load the website\n- Geoinformation: country, region, city, browser language, browser user agent \n- Events: click on \"Start questionnaire\", click on \"Resume questionnaire\", click on \"Next question\" for all questions, click on \"go back (to previous question)\" for all questions, click on \"Show previous QR code\", click on \"Print QR code\", click on \"Delete QR code\", click on \"your answers\", event \"questionnaire was completed\", event \"questionnaire was aborted\". All other events, especially events that could allow conclusions to be drawn about given answers in the questionnaire, are not recorded and transmitted. \n\nbb) Analysis for error correction\n\nFor the analysis of possible errors of the CovApp we use \"Sentry\", a tool which we also use without the possibility of disclosing data to third parties. The following information is collected for troubleshooting purposes: \n\n- Technical data, such as information about the device and browser you are using and \n- The time of a possible error or crash of the system. \n\nThe above mentioned data is only used to get information about the respective error or crash and to solve such problems. It is not possible for us to draw any conclusions about your person on the basis of the data collected for troubleshooting purposes.\n\n<strong> d) Collection of the postcode (zip code) of the place of residence and transmission to the Bundesministerium für Gesundheit in combination with the \"traffic light color”</strong>\n\nAs part of the further development of the CovApp, it is planned to ask you for the postcode of your place of residence at the end of your survey. This information will be transmitted to the Charitè Universitätsmedizin Berlin KdÖR together with the risk classification resulting from the answers to the questions. This will enable us to draw valuable conclusions for the further spatial spread of the pandemic. The legal basis for the transmission of this date, is your voluntary and informed consent in accordance with Art. 9 (2) lit. a GDPR. You can revoke your consent at any time with effect for the future. The lawfulness of the processing of your data until revocation remains unaffected.\n\nFor the Bundesministerium für Gesundheit the information - postcode and risk classification without linking to the IP address - is not personal. The information is therefore anonymous. The Bundesministerium für Gesundheit  ensures that the IP-address will not be linked to the postal code and risk classification. Depending on the development of the situation, it is conceivable that the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin KdÖR will make the data thus transmitted available to third parties for the further fight against the pandemic.\n\n<strong>4. No obligation to provide personal data</strong>\n\nYou are not obliged to provide personal data beyond the above-mentioned information when using the CovApp. You may use the CovApp to its full extent without giving your consent to analyse the use of the app. \n\n<strong>5. Recipients/categories of recipients of personal data</strong>\n\nAs part of the use of the CovApp, health-related data about you will be disclosed if you allow the QR Code to be read on-site. Apart from this, no special categories of personal data are disclosed. For the operation and further development of the web application, D4L data4life gGmbH, Charlottenstraße 109, 14467 Potsdam supports us as a data processor. We have concluded an agreement in accordance with Art. 28 Para. 3 GDPR. The Bundesministerium für Gesundheit is responsible for the processing of personal data.\n\n<strong>6. Duration of storage/deletion</strong>\n\nYour IP address is automatically anonymised at the end of your session in the CovApp. Thereafter - if you have agreed - only data collected for the purposes of pandemic control, scientific purposes and to improve the app will be processed anonymously. The storage of the postal code linked to the risk assessment is also carried out without reference to persons.\n\n<strong>7. No automated decision-making including profiling</strong>\n\nIn the context of the use and possible analysis of the CovApp, no decision is made solely on the basis of automated decision-making - including profiling - that has legal effect on you or that significantly affects you in a similar way.\n\n<strong>8. Your rights</strong>\n\nIn accordance with the GDPR, you have the following rights with regard to your personal data to the extent permitted by law: \n\n- Right of access (Art. 15 GDPR) \n- Right to rectification (Article 16 GDPR)\n- Right to erasure (Art. 17 GDPR; \"right to be forgotten\")\n- Right to restriction of processing (Art. 18 GDPR) \n- Right to object to processing (Art. 21 GDPR)\n- Right to data portability (Art. 20 GDPR)\n\nYou also have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority about the processing of your personal data if you believe that the processing of personal data concerning you is unlawful.",

Controller</strong>\n\nThe Controller of the processing of personal data when using the CovApp is \n\nRobert Koch-Institute (RKI)\nNordufer 20\n13353 Berlin \n\nPhone: <a href=\"tel:0049301875400\">030 18754 0 - 0</a>\nE-mail: <a href=\"mailto:info@rki.de\">info@rki.de</a>\n\nAs long as the data are processed exclusively on the user's terminal device with the help of the installed software, the users themselves shall be the Controllers.\n\n<strong>2. Data Protection Officer</strong>\n\nYou can contact the RKI data protection officer at our postal address (see item 1) addressing your communication: \"To the data protection officer\" as well as by e-mail at <a href=\"mailto:datenschutz@rki.de\">datenschutz(at)rki.de</a>.\n\n<strong>3. What personal data are processed, for what purposes and on what legal basis?</strong>\n\nThe CovApp is a web application. The CovApp is intended to support you in assessing whether you need further investigation regarding a potential Covid 19 infection. The CovApp’s aim is to guide you safely through the various healthcare services and, where necessary, to show you the way to hospitals or examination centers. A directly personalised login or registration is not necessary.\n\n<strong>Please be expressly informed that this offer does not replace medical advice or treatment.</strong>\n\n<strong> a) Visiting the Website</strong>\n\nThe RKI is supported in the operation and further development of CovApp by D4L data4life gGmbH, Charlottenstraße 109, 14467 Potsdam, Germany as Processor within the meaning of Article 28 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). D4L data4life gGmbH provides the server for the website.\n\nWhen accessing the website, the following data (metadata) are automatically transferred to the web server of D4L data4life gGmbH:\n\n- IP address of the device used for accessing the website\n- Web address (URL) of the page from which the data was requested (referrer)\n- Date and time of the request\n- Amount of data transmitted\n- Description of the type of web browser used.\n\nThe processing of these browser data, which does not contain the actual name of the user, but still contains a (pseudonymised) personal reference via the IP address, is technically necessary to display the website and to guarantee the website’s stability and security. The IP address is stored for a maximum period of seven days to prevent misuse of the web application and/or cyber-attacks on the servers of our Processor, D4L data4life gGmbH in Germany, and is deleted after such period. The legal basis for this data processing is Article 6(1)(e) GDPR in conjunction with § 3 of the German Data Protection Act (BDSG). \n\n\n<strong> b) Completing the questionnaire and creating a QR code</strong>\n\nThe CovApp contains questions about current symptoms, your recent trips and possible contacts you may have had. The answers you give to the questions and the recommendations for action displayed automatically based on your answers are <u>processed exclusively locally on the end-device you use (smartphone, tablet or PC)</u>; there is no data exchange with the server at this stage of using the CovApp. The answers you enter are stored separately and on your device.\n\nAfter completing the questionnaire, the answers you have given and the resulting recommendations for action can be summarised in a QR Code. This operation is also exclusively carried out locally on your end-device. The QR code generated only contains encrypted answers of the user, so that outsiders cannot see the questions or the answers given. Only at a later point in time, for example when you visit a doctor, will you be able to show the QR code stored locally on your device and give the information contained therein, for example, to your doctor. This makes it easier to record the necessary anamnesis data and noticeably reduces the burden on medical care.\n\nThe legal basis for the disclosure of your personal health data in these cases is Article 9(2)(i) GDPR in conjunction with § 22(1)(c) BDSG or, in the event of your express consent – which can be withdrawn at any time – Article 6(1)(a) and Article 9(2)(a) GDPR.\n\nYou can delete the data stored by CovApp on your terminal device at any time by clicking “Delete answers” at the end of the questionnaire.\n\n<strong> c) Survey of the postal code (ZIP code) of the place of stay and transmission of data to the Charité University Hospital Berlin together with the risk classification</strong>\n\nAt the end of your survey, you will have the opportunity to voluntarily consent to the transmission of the postal code of your place of stay. This information will be sent to the Charité University Hospital Berlin together with the risk classification resulting from the answers to the questions, but without the answers from the questionnaire. This will allow us to draw valuable conclusions on the further spread of the pandemic. The legal basis for the transmission of this data is your voluntary and informed consent under Articles 6(1)(a) and Article 9(2)(a) GDPR. You can withdraw your consent at any time with effect for the future. In such case, the lawfulness of the processing of your data until revocation shall remain unaffected.\n\nThe information – postcode and risk classification without a link to the IP address – processed by RKI is not personal, but anonymous. Depending on the development of the pandemic’s spread, the Charité University Hospital Berlin may make the data thus transmitted available to third parties to better manage containment measures against the Covid 19 pandemic.\n\n<strong> d) Possible analysis of user behaviour and error analysis</strong>\n\nYou can voluntarily consent to the analysis of your user behaviour and the troubleshooting analysis which serves to improve the service. To this end, a cookie banner will appear upon accessing the website, which will ask for your voluntary consent (linked to your IP address). Your answers to the questions are irrelevant here. Specifically, this consent concerns the analysis of user data for scientific purposes (as explained under aa below), and for the improvement of the CovApp, e.g. how often the possibility of creating and using the QR Code has been used. Your data will be anonymised before use. The legal basis is your voluntary and informed consent, pursuant to Article 6(1)(a) GDPR, to the collection and anonymisation of your personal data for use in the respective analysis. You can withdraw your consent at any time with effect for the future. In such case, the lawfulness of the processing of your data until revocation shall remain unaffected. Your consent includes the following:\n\naa) Analysis of user data for scientific purposes and for the optimisation of the application\n\nThe anonymised data obtained from the analysis of your use of the CovApp supports the RKI, among other things, in identifying clusters by evaluating periods of time, risk factors and locations thereof. Furthermore, by determining at which point the answering of the questions is frequently interrupted, we can optimise the questionnaire. This analysis enables us to draw valuable conclusions for pandemic control. It is not possible for us to draw any conclusions about you personally based on the data collected for the usage analysis.\n\nThis analysis is carried out with the help of “Matomo”, a free web analysis software, which does not transfer any data to third parties.

    "faq_content": "<strong>About the coronavirus</strong>\nThe scientific term for the novel coronavirus is „SARS-CoV-2“. This virus can cause a respiratory disease. The name of this disease is called „COVID-19“. Because the infectious disease COVID-19 has already spread across countries and continents, it's referred to as a pandemic.\n\n<strong>Transmission</strong>\nThe new coronavirus is transmitted via droplet infection. It can directly be transferred between humans, when droplets containing the virus get into the respiratory system after they are absorbed via the lining of the mouth and nose or via the conjunctiva of the eye. But an indirect infection is also possible, when droplets are transmitted via the hands to the mucosa of mouth, nose and eyes. Symptoms occur 5 to 6, at most 14 days, after infection.\n\n<strong>Symptoms</strong>\nAfter an infection with the coronavirus, the disease runs a mild course and is not life-threatening for most people. This extends to pregnant women and children. There can be flu-like symptoms, such as a dry cough, fatigue and fever. Furthermore, some patients suffer from a sore throat, headaches, limb pain and chills. Currently it’s been assumed that 4 in 5 cases run a mild course. Though in some patients the infection can have a serious course, causing respiratory distress and bilateral pneumonia. This mostly affects elderly persons or people with chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, chronic lung disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, or cancer. Those severe cases have to be treated in intensive care in a hospital.\n\n<strong>Solidarity</strong>\nAlthough there is a very good healthcare system available in Germany, it is not prepared for a rapid increase in intensive care patients. But if it is possible to prolong an increase in severe cases, treatment of infected patients will continue to be available. This can only be done if every citizen practices social distancing. As a precautionary measure, especially for the elderly generation and the chronically ill, everyone should take the situation seriously and avoid social contact as much as possible. But please, provide for elderly and chronically ill relatives or neighbors and living alone or persons in need with food and daily life essentials. Be considerate and attentive for their needs and worries. Communicate with each other – but stay at least 1.5 meters apart. Act in solidarity.\n\n<strong>Protection</strong>\nTo slow down the spreading of the virus, avoid direct contact, for example when meeting someone. Wash your hands regularly and thoroughly, at least 20 seconds with soap and water. Keep as much distance as possible when coughing or sneezing – turn away from other people. Sneeze into a sleeve or a tissue, which you throw into a bin immediately. Don’t share something you touched with your mouth, like a glass or a bottle, with someone else. Stay at home.\n\n<strong>Therapy</strong>\nThe therapy of the infection depends on the severity of the disease. Mild cases don’t have to be treated and can get well at home. Severe pneumonia has to be treated, for example with oxygen treatment, fluid substitution or antibiotics to treat bacterial co-infections. This mostly has to be done in a hospital.\n\n<strong>Vaccination</strong>\nResearchers are currently working on developing a vaccine. Right now, there is no vaccination available which protects against the new coronavirus.\n\n<strong>Get help</strong>\nViolence against women support Hotline: <a href=\"tel:+4980000116016\">08000 116 016</a>\nCrisis Hotline: <a href=\"tel:+498001110111\">0800 111 0 111</a> or <a href=\"tel:+498001110222\">0800 111 0 222</a>\n\n<strong>Stay informed</strong>\nThe <a href=\"https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/coronavirus.html\" target=\"_blank\">German Ministry of Health</a> regularly updates the information on the coronavirus.\n\nCharité researcher Prof. Dr. Christian Drosten keeps you up-to-date on the <a href=\"https://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/info/Corona-Podcast-Alle-Folgen-in-der-Uebersicht,podcastcoronavirus134.html\" target=\"_blank\">NDR podcast</a>",

Please note that this app does not provide diagnostic services.</p>\n<br />\n<p>In this way, the CovApp can help you to better assess your medical condition, provide recommendations regarding doctor’s visits or coronavirus testing, and summarize relevant medical information for future doctor’s consultation.</p>",

Preparation for doctor’s visit</strong></p>\n<p>When you're given the advice for a doctor’s visit or a visit to one of the coronavirus testing sites, please bring the QR code or print the summary presented. Some coronavirus testing sites (like the Charité) can scan the code so that your answers are made directly available to our medical staff and can be used for your consultation.
