      "faq_content": "<strong>About the coronavirus</strong>\nThe scientific term for the novel coronavirus is „SARS-CoV-2“. This virus can cause a respiratory disease. The name of this disease is called „COVID-19“. Because the infectious disease COVID-19 has already spread across countries and continents, it's referred to as a pandemic.\n\n<strong>Transmission</strong>\nThe new coronavirus is transmitted via droplet infection. It can directly be transferred between humans, when droplets containing the virus get into the respiratory system after they are absorbed via the lining of the mouth and nose or via the conjunctiva of the eye. But an indirect infection is also possible, when droplets are transmitted via the hands to the mucosa of mouth, nose and eyes. Symptoms occur 5 to 6, at most 14 days, after infection. \n\n<strong>Symptoms</strong>\nAfter an infection with the coronavirus, the disease runs a mild course and is not life-threatening for most people. This extends to pregnant women and children. There can be flu-like symptoms, such as a dry cough, fatigue and fever. Furthermore, some patients suffer from a sore throat, headaches, limb pain and chills. Currently it’s been assumed that 4 in 5 cases run a mild course. Though in some patients the infection can have a serious course, causing respiratory distress and bilateral pneumonia. This mostly affects elderly persons or people with chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, chronic lung disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, or cancer. Those severe cases have to be treated in intensive care in a hospital.\n\n<strong>Solidarity</strong>\nAlthough there is a very good healthcare system available in Germany, it is not prepared for a rapid increase in intensive care patients. But if it is possible to prolong an increase in severe cases, treatment of infected patients will continue to be available. This can only be done if every citizen practices social distancing. As a precautionary measure, especially for the elderly generation and the chronically ill, everyone should take the situation seriously and avoid social contact as much as possible. But please, provide for elderly and chronically ill relatives or neighbors and living alone or persons in need with food and daily life essentials. Be considerate and attentive for their needs and worries. Communicate with each other – but stay at least 1 meter apart. Act in solidarity.\n\n<strong>Protection</strong>\nTo slow down the spreading of the virus, avoid direct contact, for example when meeting someone. Wash your hands regularly and thoroughly, at least 20 seconds with soap and water. Keep as much distance as possible when coughing or sneezing – turn away from other people. Sneeze into a sleeve or a tissue, which you throw into a bin immediately. Don’t share something you touched with your mouth, like a glass or a bottle, with someone else. Stay at home.\n\n<strong>Therapy</strong>\nThe therapy of the infection depends on the severity of the disease. Mild cases don’t have to be treated and can get well at home. Severe pneumonia has to be treated, for example with oxygen treatment, fluid substitution or antibiotics to treat bacterial co-infections. This mostly has to be done in a hospital.\n\n<strong>Vaccination</strong>\nResearchers are currently working on developing a vaccine. Right now, there is no vaccination available which protects against the new coronavirus.\n\n<strong>Get help</strong>\nPlease contact your your country's hotline\n\n<strong>Emergency</strong>\nPlease contact your country's emergency number",
