      "data_privacy_content": "(Status: 4. May 2020)\n \n<strong>1. Controller</strong>\nThe responsible controller according to Art. 4 para. 7 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is D4L data4life gGmbH, Rudolf-Breitscheid-Straße 185–189, 14482 Potsdam, Germany, we@data4life.care.\nAs long as the data is processed exclusively on the user's device with the help of the installed software, the users themselves are controllers.\n \n<strong>2. Data protection officer</strong>\nYou can contact our data protection officer by e-mail (datenschutz@data4life.care) or by sending a letter to our postal address (with the attention of \"the data protection officer\").\n \n<strong>3. Which data is processed for which purposes and on which legal basis?</strong>\n<strong>a. Visiting the website</strong>\nThe CovApp is a web application. When the web page is called, the following data is automatically transferred to the web server:<ul><li>IP address of the device used for the retrieval</li><li>Web address (URL) of the page from which the file was requested (referrer)</li><li>Date and time of the request</li><li>Amount of data transmitted</li><li>Description of the type of web browser used.</li></ul>The processing of this browser data, which does not show a clear name of the user, but which nevertheless contains a (pseudonymised) personal reference via the IP address, is technically necessary and is carried out in our legitimate interest in showing you our website and in ensuring the stability and security of the website. The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The above-mentioned data will not be stored for a longer period of time after your use of the app\n \n<strong>b. Filling out the questionnaire and creating a QR code</strong>\nThe CovApp should help you to assess whether there is a need for further clarification regarding a Covid-19 infection. Please note, however, that CovApp does not provide any diagnostic or medical services and does not replace treatment and/or advice from a doctor. You can use CovApp without a registration or any form of user account.\nThe CovApp contains questions about current symptoms and possible interactions. The answers you give to the questions and the automatically displayed recommendations for action depending on your answers are processed exclusively locally on the device you use (smartphone, tablet or notebook); at this stage no data is transmitted to the server. Your answers to the questionnaire are stored local and protected on your device only.\nIt is possible to summarize the answers and further information you have provided in a QR code after the questionnaire has been completed. This is also done purely locally and without data exchange with a server. At a later point in time, for example when you visit a hospital for an appointment, it is possible for you to show the QR code stored locally on your device and to transmit the information contained therein. This makes it easier to collect the necessary health related data and reduces the time needed for admission at the hospital.\nThe legal basis for the disclosure of your health-related data in these cases is Art. 9 para. 2 lit. i GDPR. If a hospital treatment contract is concluded, the legal basis of the state hospital act applies, e.g. in Berlin it is Section 24 of the Berlin State Hospital Act. From the time of disclosure - and subsequent data processing in a hospital information system - the data protection information provided by the hospital apply.\nYou can delete the data stored by CovApp on your terminal device at any time by clicking \"Delete answers\" at the end of the questionnaire.\n \n<strong>c. Possible analysis of user behavior and error analysis</strong>\nYou can voluntarily agree to the analysis of your user behaviour and the error analysis serving to improve the offer. For this purpose, a cookie banner appears at the beginning of the visit to the website, which asks for your voluntary consent (linked to your IP address). Sensitive answers to the questions are not recorded for the analysis. The analysis is focused on the evaluation of user behaviour data to improve the CovApp, i.e. how often the questionnaire is filled out. Your data will be anonymised before use. The legal basis for this is your voluntary and informed consent under Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR to the collection and anonymisation of your personal data for use in the relevant analysis. You can revoke your consent at any time with effect for the future. The legality of the processing of your data until revocation remains unaffected. Your consent includes the following:\n \na) Analysis of user data to optimize the application\nThe anonymised data obtained from the analysis of your use of the CovApp helps to optimize the CovApp. By determining at which point the answering of the questions is frequently interrupted, we can optimize the questionnaire.\nIt is not possible for us to draw any conclusions about your person on the basis of the data collected for usage analysis. Especially, it does not allow us or anybody else to draw any conclusions regarding your personal health.\nThe analysis is carried out with the help of \"Matomo\", a free web analysis software that does not transfer any data to third parties. The following data is collected by Matomo and processed anonymously for the usage analysis:<ul><li>IP address;</li><li>Date and time of the request;</li><li>Title of the URLs viewed, URLs of the web pages viewed, URLs of previous web pages (only within the app);</li><li>Screen resolution, time in your own time zone, time to load the website;</li><li>Geoinformation: country, region, city, browser language, browser user agent and</li><li>Events: Click on \"Start questionnaire\", click on \"Next question\" for all questions, click on \"Print QR Code\", click on \"Delete QR Code\", click on \"Your answers\". All other events, especially events that could allow conclusions to be drawn about given answers in the questionnaire, are not recorded and transmitted.</li></ul>The above mentioned data is only stored and processed on servers owned and controlled by D4L data4life gGmbH. All servers are located in Germany.\n \nb) Support/Contact\nWhen you contact us using the contact form provided on our website or by email, post, or telephone using the contact channels listed in the imprint, the data you provide (for example, your email address and your name as well as the content of your inquiry) will be stored by us in order to process and answer your questions or concerns or to provide the support you require when using the CovApp.\nWe delete the data arising in this context after the storage is no longer necessary (usually after we fully answer your request), or restrict the processing if there are legal storage obligations. The legal basis for the processing of the above described data if you contact us is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR (processing is necessary to safeguard the legitimate interests of the controller). We have a legitimate interest in providing a contact option to the user that is easy to use, e.g. contact formular or email communication.\n \n<strong>4. Obligation to provide personal data</strong>\nYou must supply your IP-address if you visit the CovApp. The IP-address is needed for technical reasons, and is supplied automatically in the background by your browser, in order to enable the data transfer between your device (notebook, tablet, smartphone) and the server. We can not make the offering available to you if you do not wish to provide your IP address.\nYou may use the CovApp to its full extent without giving your consent to analyse your usage behaviour of the app.\n \n<strong>5. Recipients / categories of recipients of personal data</strong>\nAs part of the use of the CovApp, health-related data about you will be disclosed if you allow the QR Code to be read on-site at the hospital.\nFor the hosting and operations of https://covapp-XX.data4life.care, in which “XX” represents the ISO 639-1 language code of the target region, Amazon Web Services EMEA SARL, 38 Avenue John F. Kennedy, L-1855, Luxembourg, ATTN: AWS EMEA Legal supports us as a data processor. We have concluded an agreement in accordance with Art. 28 Para. 3 GDPR. The responsible controller according to Art. 4 para. 7 GDPR is still D4L data4life gGmbH.\nApart from this, no special categories of personal data are disclosed.\n \n<strong>6. Duration of storage / deletion</strong>\nYour IP address is not stored for a longer period of time. Thereafter - if you have agreed - only data collected for the purposes of improving the app will be processed anonymously.\n \n<strong>7. No automated decision making including profiling</strong>\nIn the context of the use and possible analysis of the CovApp, no decision is made solely on the basis of automated decision-making - including profiling - that has legal effect on you or that significantly affects you in a similar way.\n \n<strong>8. Your rights</strong>\nIn accordance with the GDPR, you have the following rights with regard to your personal data to the extent permitted by law:<ul><li>Right of access (Art. 15 GDPR),</li><li>Right to rectification (Article 16 GDPR),</li><li>Right to erasure (Art. 17 GDPR; \"right to be forgotten\"),</li><li>Right to restriction of processing (Art. 18 GDPR),</li><li>Right to object to processing (Art. 21 GDPR),</li><li>Right to data portability (Art. 20 GDPR).</li></ul>\n \n<strong>a. Right to lodge a complaint</strong>\nYou also have the right to complain about our processing of your personal data to a data protection supervisory authority in the member state where you are located, at your place of work or at the location of the alleged infringement if you believe that the processing of your personal data is unlawful. For complaints please contact:\n \nDie Landesbeauftragte für den Datenschutz und für das Recht auf Akteneinsicht\nStahnsdorfer Damm 77\n14532 Kleinmachnow\nGermany\n \nTelefon: 033203/356-0\nTelefax: 033203/356-49\nEmail: Poststelle@LDA.Brandenburg.de\n \n<strong>b. Supplementary note about your right of objection</strong>\nPlease note that if your personal data is processed on the basis of a legitimate interest within the scope of the balancing of interests pursuant to Art. 6 para.1 sentence 1 f) GDPR, you have the right to object to the processing of your personal data at any time. You can indicate your objection by contacting us at any time using the contact channels listed in Section 1 and/or the contact information in our imprint.",

      "faq_content": "<strong>About the coronavirus</strong>\nThe scientific term for the novel coronavirus is „SARS-CoV-2“. This virus can cause a respiratory disease. The name of this disease is called „COVID-19“. Because the infectious disease COVID-19 has already spread across countries and continents, it's referred to as a pandemic.\n\n<strong>Transmission</strong>\nThe new coronavirus is transmitted via droplet infection. It can directly be transferred between humans, when droplets containing the virus get into the respiratory system after they are absorbed via the lining of the mouth and nose or via the conjunctiva of the eye. But an indirect infection is also possible, when droplets are transmitted via the hands to the mucosa of mouth, nose and eyes. Symptoms occur 5 to 6, at most 14 days, after infection.\n\n<strong>Symptoms</strong>\nAfter an infection with the coronavirus, the disease runs a mild course and is not life-threatening for most people. This extends to pregnant women and children. There can be flu-like symptoms, such as a dry cough, fatigue and fever. Furthermore, some patients suffer from a sore throat, headaches, limb pain and chills. Currently it’s been assumed that 4 in 5 cases run a mild course. Though in some patients the infection can have a serious course, causing respiratory distress and bilateral pneumonia. This mostly affects elderly persons or people with chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, chronic lung disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, or cancer. Those severe cases have to be treated in intensive care in a hospital.\n\n<strong>Solidarity</strong>\nAlthough there is a very good healthcare system available in Germany, it is not prepared for a rapid increase in intensive care patients. But if it is possible to prolong an increase in severe cases, treatment of infected patients will continue to be available. This can only be done if every citizen practices social distancing. As a precautionary measure, especially for the elderly generation and the chronically ill, everyone should take the situation seriously and avoid social contact as much as possible. But please, provide for elderly and chronically ill relatives or neighbors and living alone or persons in need with food and daily life essentials. Be considerate and attentive for their needs and worries. Communicate with each other – but stay at least 1.5 meters apart. Act in solidarity.\n\n<strong>Protection</strong>\nTo slow down the spreading of the virus, avoid direct contact, for example when meeting someone. Wash your hands regularly and thoroughly, at least 20 seconds with soap and water. Keep as much distance as possible when coughing or sneezing – turn away from other people. Sneeze into a sleeve or a tissue, which you throw into a bin immediately. Don’t share something you touched with your mouth, like a glass or a bottle, with someone else. Stay at home.\n\n<strong>Therapy</strong>\nThe therapy of the infection depends on the severity of the disease. Mild cases don’t have to be treated and can get well at home. Severe pneumonia has to be treated, for example with oxygen treatment, fluid substitution or antibiotics to treat bacterial co-infections. This mostly has to be done in a hospital.\n\n<strong>Vaccination</strong>\nResearchers are currently working on developing a vaccine. Right now, there is no vaccination available which protects against the new coronavirus.",
